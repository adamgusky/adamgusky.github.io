  Hey Friends,

  Thanks for checking out adamgusky.com. This site is dope, isn't it? Anyways, at the end of June I moved to Boulder, CO, to fulfill an internship for the rest of the summer with Emerson Stone.

  Emerson Stone is a product-focused design agency. It has been very inspiring to be around such a talented and friendly group of developers and designers. Lately, I've been spending most of my time working on a macOS app that should be launched by September.

  Outside of work, I've been spending time working out, playing guitar, and hanging out with the friends I've met here. I've done multiple hikes in Rocky Mountain National Park, I competed in a cycling race in Littleton, and I went mountain biking at Betasso. I'd say I've been doing a pretty good job at experiencing some of the better things Colorado has to offer, during my short time here.

  Again, thanks for visiting my new site! If you have any blog post recommendations, leave me a note on my contact me page.
