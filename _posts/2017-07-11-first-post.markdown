I was born and raised in Appleton, Wi and go to school in La Crosse, Wi.
This summer I am living in Boulder, CO, doing an internship with Emerson
Stone. I am currently spending most of my time working on a Mac OS project
using swift. Outside of work I enjoy spending my time on my bike, hiking the
many trails in Colorado, and touring the city with friends.
